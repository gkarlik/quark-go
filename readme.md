# quark-go

Quark-go is a quark size (meaning very very small) toolbelt for building microservices in golang. 

**Important**: Work in progress! Some interfaces could be changed!

## Goals
The goal of the project is to help quickly build microservices using distributed programming best practices and tools which are 
best in the class (choice is subjective). Common techniques and components are at disposal of a developer who should be 
focus more on business logic instead of tweaking and finding right tools to do the job.

Quark-go is very extensible and allows to implement custom providers for all specified features below. It is not the goal of the project
to support all available tools, configurations and components on the market. Project is focused to deliver community proven best preconfigured tools
and components prepared OOTB to use it in your projects.

If you are interesed in more "enterprise" solutions. Please see the following projects:
* [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit)
* [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro)

## Features
* **Authentication** - module for HTTP [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) authentication
* **Message Broker** - asynchronous messaging using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
* **Circuit Breaker** - custom implementation of [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)
* **Logging** - structured service diagnostics using [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library
* **Metrics Collection** - service metrics collection using [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)
* **Rate Limiter** - custom implementation of HTTP rate limiter
* **Service Discovery** - service discovery using [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
* **Load Balancing** - custom implementation of load balancing strategy
* **RPC** - Remote Procedure Call client and server using [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) library
* **Request Tracing** - using [opentracing](http://opentracing.io/) and [zipkin](http://zipkin.io/)

## Planned features
* **More security** - HTTP headers, OpenID Connect etc.
* **Searchability** - Elasticsearch indexing and searching
* **Data Access Layer** - patterns for accessing data (relational and document oriented)
* **Caching** - data caching patterns
